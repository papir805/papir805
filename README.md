### Glad to see you here!  
Hi, my name is Jonathan. 

I have more than fifteen years of experience in mathematics, with five years as a reporting analyst. I thoroughly enjoy problem-solving and derive satisfaction from successfully tackling a complex problem. Having spent some time as a teacher and tutor, I also have a knack for communicating complex ideas in a way that is easy to digest, and I enjoy learning, especially if it relates to math in some way.

Several years ago, I was introduced to data science and immediately became interested. I had never seen such novel and intriguing solutions to problems before, and witnessing data science blend statistics, calculus, and linear algebra was eye-opening. To work with large amounts of data, I began beefing up my technical skills through self-learning in my spare time.

Now, I'm proficient in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel, and I'm looking for a job as a data analyst. I've spent time creating personal projects to showcase my skills and track my progress on data analytics/data science-related topics.


# Repositories:
### Featured Projects
1. [electroniCart Sales Analysis](https://github.com/papir805/ElectroniCart-Sales-Analysis): An analysis of transaction records for an electronics retailer examining trends in sales, refunds, and the loyalty program providing recommendations to the sales, inventory, and loyalty teams.
    * Tools used: PostgreSQL, Excel, Tableau
2. [Bot Battles Player Analysis](https://github.com/papir805/bot_battles_player_analysis): Conducted regional and seasonal analysis of in-game activity and player demographics for use by the marketing team to optimize budgets, time ad campaigns, and target specific segments.
    * Tools used: Python, PostgreSQL
3. [TelePulse Ad Campaign Report](https://github.com/papir805/telepulse_ad_campaign_report): Conducted and summarized analysis of ad data for the VP of marketing that recommends channels for increased and decreased ad spend.
    * Tools used: Python

<!-- ### Python projects
1. [craigslist_web_scraper](https://github.com/papir805/craigslist_web_scraper) - An ETL web scraper that grabs prices of other math tutors, which I can use to compare my tutoring services against and better understand my competition in the market.
    * Important libraries used: `Requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Psycopg2`, `Sklearn`

2. [accounting_analysis](https://github.com/papir805/accounting_analysis) - An analysis of data from a Reddit survey on r/accounting that provided insight into the profession my wife was transitioning into, enabling her to tailor her job search accordingly.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Sklearn`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`

3. [TV_advertising_campaign_report](https://github.com/papir805/ad_campaign_report) - This script cleans TV ad data, performs joins, and calculates important metrics, then generates and exports three reports as PDF files.  These reports were used to produce recommendations for TV networks where ad spending should be increased/decreased.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

4. [acpuncture_scholarly_anaysis](https://github.com/papir805/acupuncture_scholarly_analysis) - A fun way to practice using Python libraries to implement statistical techniques that I teach in class, such as hypothesis testing, construction of confidence intervals, and linear regression.  The goal was to understand acupuncture treatments and their effects on hypertension.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`

5. [Pok√©mon_classification](https://github.com/papir805/pokemon_classification) - A k-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Classifier that predict a binary response, whether a newly observed Pok√©mon would be legendary or not.  Both models achieved 92-94% testing accuracy.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `Sklearn`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

6. [ISLR2e_Python](https://github.com/papir805/ISLR2) - The textbook <i>[Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com) </i>(ISLR) released a second edition in August 2021, with three new chapters that were not present in the first edition.  This project takes R code from the labs in these three chapters and ports it to Python and answers each chapters' exercises in Python too.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Sklearn`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`, `Tensorflow`/`Keras`, `Patsy`, `glmnet_python`
<br/>

### SQL projects
1. [Case Study: Mobile App Gaming Data](https://github.com/papir805/mobile_app_data_analysis)
This case study was given to me to determine whether there's any correlation between user attributes and user performance based on data from a mobile gaming company. The project is broken into three parts:
    * Loading and cleaning the data into a PostgreSQL database
    * Performing an exploratory data analysis
    * Using hypothesis testing and regression modeling to answer the question about correlation
<br/>

# Tableau:
1. [US_accounting_viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.papir/viz/us_accounting_viz/GenderStory) - A story about gender differences among male and female accountants using cleaned data from the r/accounting survey in the [accounting_analysis](https://github.com/papir805/accounting_analysis) mentioned above.

2. [National Tutoring Prices Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.papir/viz/shared/4QQYYS4Z6) - An interactive dashboard, which can be used to understand tutoring prices at the national, regional, state, and local level, using data scraped from Craigslist in my [craigslist_web_scraper](https://github.com/papir805/craigslist_web_scraper).
<br/>

# PowerPoint Presentations:
1. [TV advertising campaign report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T-fGZ3Cf7lJvf4lJWJhyOq45gDOGqSKuG6wpV-fVQLo/edit?usp=sharing) - Presentation using two months worth of TV ad data that provides recommendations for which TV networks to increase/decrease ad spending on.
