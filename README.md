### Glad to see you here!  
Hi, my name is Jonathan. I have more than fifteen years of experience working with mathematics, over five of which has been spent as a math teacher who specializes in statistics and calculus. I thoroughly enjoy problem solving and derive satisfaction from being able to work a problem through to completion. Coming from a teaching background, I have a knack for communicating complex ideas in a way that is easy to digest and I enjoy learning, especially if it relates to math in some way.

Roughly three years ago, I was introduced to the idea of data science and immediately became interested. Mathematical applications excite me and seeing data science blend statistics, calculus, and linear algebra together to solve novel and intriguing problems was eye opening. I was off on my journey and began dedicating all of my free time to learning the requisite skills which would enable me to work with data.

Now, I have a more varied skill set that is not just conceptual in nature, but is grounded in hands-on experience, spanning a wide array of software and data management systems. I am proficient with SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL), Tableau, Python, and Excel, and continue to learn more each day, with a robust eagerness that hasn‚Äôt waned. 

I also hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in International Business from San Jose State University and can view data from the business perspective. This enables me to understand ways in which data can provide crucial insights to solve business problems. It's helped me successfully run my own tutoring business for over 15 years, with many satisfied, repeat customers.

Currently, I'm looking for my first job as a Data Analyst/Scientist and in order to demonstrate proficiency, have spent time building up repositories on GitHub to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress on data analytics / data science related topics. Please take a look through the repositories here, I hope you find them interesting.


# Repositories:

### Python projects
1. [craigslist_web_scraper](https://github.com/papir805/craigslist_web_scraper) - An ETL web scraper that grabs prices of other math tutors, which I can use to compare my tutoring services against and better understand my competition in the market.
    * Important libraries used: `Requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Psycopg2`, `Sklearn`
2. [accounting_analysis](https://github.com/papir805/accounting_analysis) - An analysis of data from a Reddit survey on r/accounting that provided insight into the profession my wife was transitioning into.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Sklearn`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`

3. [TV_advertising_campaign_report](https://github.com/papir805/ad_campaign_report) - This script cleans TV ad data, performs joins, and calculates important metrics, then generates and exports three reports as PDF files, which can be used to produce recommendations for TV networks where ad spending should be increased/decreased.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

4. [acpuncture_scholarly_anaysis](https://github.com/papir805/acupuncture_scholarly_analysis) - A fun way to practice using Python libraries to implement statistical techniques that I teach in class, such as hypothesis testing, construction of confidence intervals, and linear regression.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`

5. [Pok√©mon_classification](https://github.com/papir805/pokemon_classification) - To practice classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning, I attempted to build several models that predict a binary response, whether a newly observed Pok√©mon would be legendary or not.
    * Important libraries used: `Pandas`, `Sklearn`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
<br/>

### SQL Queries - ways to practice my knowledge of joins, window functions, subqueries, common table expressions and more
1. [advanced_sql_puzzles](https://github.com/papir805/advanced_sql_puzzles)
    * All queries in MySQL
2. [stratascratch_sql_puzzles](https://github.com/papir805/stratascratch_SQL_puzzles)
    * All queries in PostgreSQL
<br/>

# Tableau:
1. [US_accounting_viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.papir/viz/us_accounting_viz/GenderStory) - A story about gender differences among male and female accountants using cleaned data from the r/accounting survey in the [accounting_analysis](https://github.com/papir805/accounting_analysis) mentioned above.
<br/>


# PowerPoint Presentations:
1. [TV advertising campaign report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T-fGZ3Cf7lJvf4lJWJhyOq45gDOGqSKuG6wpV-fVQLo/edit?usp=sharing) - Presentation on two months worth of TV ad data and recommendations for which TV networks to increase/decrease ad spending on.
